# Repository Component - Object Labeler Final Project
Welcome to my GitHub.  This is the GitHub repo for the Repository component of my ECE-533 Final Project.

This code contains the frontend user-interface of the application.  Initially it was developed on Google's Firebase.  I will be adding a proper NoSQL database along with a NodeJS Backend.  The link for the backend portion of the project can be found below.  

If you're unfamiliar with a React project, you'll find the source code within the /src directory and its various child directories.  Of course the dependencies can be found in the package.json file. 

If you clone the project, in order to run it you'd use:

$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps

$ npm start

That being said, you will still get compilation errors unless you set up a .env file with your Firebase project credentials.
